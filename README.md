# Kotlin Clean Architecture Multiplatform [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xurxodev/kotlin-clean-architecture-multiplatform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xurxodev/kotlin-clean-architecture-multiplatform/)

This example shows how to create a Android app and iOS app using Kotlin multiplatform and Clean Architecture.

This sample based on the [multiplatform documentation](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html).
If you have questions about the structure or how it works take a look at the documentation there.


## iOS

To compile the project from Xcode just open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` and run the application.

Xcode has been configured according to [Multiplatform Project: iOS and Android documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/native/mpp-ios-android.html)

To compile a framework from the command line execute:

```
  > ./gradlew :core-multiplatform:packForXCode
```

This example use the code analysis tool [swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).

To execute code analysis

```shell
swiftlint 
```
Or build app

To execute code format

```shell
swiftlint autocorrect
```

## Android

The application can be built and executed on a device or emulator using Android Studio 3.2 or higher.
One can also compile the application and run tests from the command line:

```
   > ./gradlew :androidApp:build
```

This example use the code analysis tool ktlint.

Please configure Android Studio according to instructions in [ktlint readme](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint).

To execute code analysis

```shell
./gradlew ktlint 
```

Or build app

To execute code format

```shell
./gradlew ktlintformat
```
